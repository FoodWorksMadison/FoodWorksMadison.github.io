            It's long past time (long, loong, looong past time) that I updated
            you about what's going on with FoodWorks. I would like to apologize
            for that, personally. I have a number of explanations for what has
            taken so long, but really none of it matters; I hope that in this
            update you see mostly good news and feel encouraged that you backed
            a good team and a good project, and though there are downs as well
            as ups, we are operating with full candor and transparency as best
            we are able. So... I'm sorry to have been out of touch. Thanks for
            sticking by us.

            In many ways, the project has been “on pause”. This means that we
            haven’t been burning our funding, but it also means that we haven’t
            trained anyone since last year. But we’re spinning up the wheels
            again now!

            I have also had a "side project": with my brother and some
            colleagues I helped to launch Working Draft Beer Company, which
            celebrated its first birthday in March. There is strong
            cross-pollination with FoodWorks there, as our two First Course
            teachers started the food program at the brewery and work there
            today, turning out fine locally-sourced and seasonal food, and
            mentoring cooks.

              You probably know, but to-date we’ve run two rounds of First

              We’ve not had the best of luck keeping track of everyone, but
              several of those we are still in touch with have decent
              good-paying full time jobs in the field.

              <strong>Professionalizing:</strong> making sure all our permits,
              charity status, insurances, bookkeeping services, bank accounts,
              payroll fees and taxes, and so on are all in order.

              <strong>Official Federal Tax Exempt Status</strong>: It took
              almost a year and lots of forms, but FoodWorks Madison is a

          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            FoodWorks is in-effect, a dot-connecting organization. It sits
            between social services organizations that have deep roots serving
            community needs and the food-based business community.
          </p>

          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            <strong
              >We conceived of FirstCourse training to offer a fast-track
              pipeline to help those who want to work in the culinary sector get
              skills, confidence, and connections to find good fitting and
              stable jobs.</strong
            >
            To do this well, we need strong and deep connections in those two
            communities, and rather than try and build this capacity from
            scratch, it’s better to rely on existing institutions and
            individuals who have the necessary expertise, connections,
            credibility and trust. To connect there, we need more minds and more
            hands on board. To whit, we are recruiting new board members from
            both Madison's culinary industry, and the social services sector.
            Each will lead teams of volunteers and collaborators to service the
            two ends of our pipeline.

            We're excited to announce that
            <strong>Phillip Hurley has joined the FWmsn board</strong>. You may
            know him from Sardine, Marigold Kitchen, and Gates & Brovi. He's
            been a guest instructor at First Course, and his enthusiasm for the
            program, the students, and sharing his knowledge was infectious for
            teachers and students alike. As a chef and a business-owner of three
            different kinds of restaurants, he brings the key perspective of an
            experienced employer to our strategies. We're lucky to have his

      It took a long time and lots of work to get rewards out; it’s possible

      Some of the rewards were to be fulfilled via a vendor who is no longer a

      This isn't published yet. It's a personal priority for me; I am a

      teachers to capture their improvements to the initial curriculum design,
      and to photograph and document everything.

      The good news is that in the last couple of years, there have been a

      <h1 class="lh-title blue">Some of What We’ve Learned:</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="fn fl-ns w-60-ns">
          <h2 class="black-50">About the Curriculum</h2>
          <h3 class="black-40">Revisions</h3>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            At this point, the curriculum has effectively hit its fourth revision.
            The first cut was from our friend Shannon Vakil via the UW education
            department who we hired to help us capture and formalize the initial
            ideas. This was (and is) great — and we will also publish this version —
            but chef/teacher Jon Churan and I thought that it was too monolithic,
            and that the class would benefit from modularizing the various
            subjects/topics so that the schedule could be moved around if necessary.
            (See an example weekly and daily schedule below.) Sometimes at FEED
            Kitchens, where we’ve taught, we walked in to find that the equipment we
            planned to teach on/with was occupied by another crew working hard to
            stock up a food truck or cater an event. So we needed to be able to
            pivot and adapt (just like a real kitchen) and that meant the ability to
            swap out modules. But for sure, the spirit, pacing, and care for
            students and learning from the original founding document stayed in
            there.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            The modularization will aid others who would like to use components of
            FirstCourse without necessarily wanting to do the whole thing. It will
            also make it easier for me to finally get the modules open-sourced
            &lt;wink&gt;.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            The third revision happened after we wrapped the first round of class;
            Jon and I sat down, reviewed our notes, incorporated feedback from
            students and guest instructors, and made some changes. We did the same
            after the second round of classes.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            An example of something we changed in those revisions: we axed quizzes…
            one of our guiding bedrock principles when we designed FirstCourse is
            “what’s it like in a real kitchen?” This way, class is not just
            training, but it’s experience. And it turns out, there aren’t quizzes at
            a real job. Additionally, we noticed that students really struggled with
            written quizzes, even when they knew the material backwards and
            forwards. Not every person thrives on written performance evaluation,
            and since it didn’t track with anything in the real world of a kitchen
            job, we ditched it in favor of other ways to evaluate learning
            retention.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We also added more hands-on work. Again, trying to copy a “real” job,
            where often a worker will arrive at work to find a prep-list or other
            note about what to do, we modeled exercises on that situation: Chef Jon
            and teacher Ryan would write up a prep list incorporating several of the
            lessons, vocabulary words, techniques, tools, and ingredients that we
            had covered so far. Critically we added two other key components to this
            time: working together, and a trick. We wanted the students to get
            familiar with negotiating the dividing up of tasks, supporting one
            another with skills and double-checking skills and knowledge, and just
            cooperation… again, just like a real kitchen. And for the trick, we
            would hide a trick into the list; for example we might write “chop
            onions” but not how many, or what kind of cut. In FirstCourse, we
            relentlessly tell students to get good at asking questions, and to ask
            early and often: it’s better to ask and get it right than to guess and
            get it wrong. Hiding the tricks into these exercises was good practice,
            and if/when they forgot to ask, it was a good moment to re-teach. I came
            to enjoy these times of class the most; watching the students remix
            their accumulated skills, knowledge, and problem solving in real time
            really showed me how what we made was coming together.

          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            No doubt we will continue to refine and adapt the curriculum modules,
            and I look forward to collaborating with some of you on your
            contributions and critiques.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="black-50">Over-reliance on our great teachers?</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            A design goal of the FirstCourse curriculum was “that any competent
            teacher can teach nearly anyone to be useful in a kitchen job in three
            weeks.” So far, I suspect that this goal might be overly optimistic: the
            quality of training currently relies heavily on the fact that our
            teachers have deep experience, high skill, strong empathy, and a
            passionate commitment to the concept. (All the educators in the audience
            are now saying “duh!”) It will be a challenge to distill some of this
            expertise into a document or process that others can follow, but we’re
            going to keep at it.
          </p>
          <h2 class="black-50">About the Employment Market:</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            It continues to be crazy. Employers continue to have trouble finding
            adequate help, let alone skilled and experienced help. Here’s a
            <a href="https://madison.com/ct/entertainment/dining/still-hiring-madison-restaurants-struggle-for-staff-nears-a-crisis/article_34f719a9-e53b-5e0f-89a9-46e2f4f4cfdf.html#tracking-source=home-top-story"
              target="_blank" title="Article in the Capital Times">good article</a>
            from the local paper earlier this year on the subject. In fact, one of
            our founders just announced the closing of his flagship restaurant,
            citing inadequate staffing (among other factors) for the difficult
            decision.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            For FirstCourse, this has positives and negatives. One would think that
            this would mean that the demand for our training would go up, but what
            we’re seeing is that those who are interested in these kinds of jobs can
            often just get the job — without training — such is the need that
            employers have. We continue to believe that both workers and employers
            would benefit from the training, and that we can offer good value to
            both sides of the equation, and we will need to press our case a little
            harder: that a trained worker is a better hiring risk for employers and
            managers, and for workers, that training will help them succeed in the
            long run.

            The GOOD news about this labor shortage is that we are seeing wages and
            benefits going up, and we are seeing some bosses commit to more
            worker-friendly policies and management. Ultimately, this is a
            meta-level goal for us at FoodWorks, so we’re happy to see it continuing
            to get better.

          <h2 class="black-50">About Reaching People</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We have had serious challenges reaching the right students. We knew this
            would be hard, and it has been, and most of our strategies haven’t
            worked well. We had public information sessions in public libraries, we
            had sessions hosted at social service organizations like the Urban
            League, we put up signs at community centers, we told employers to
            spread the word, and more. But in the end, we had to work pretty hard to
            fill our classes, probably spending 3+ hours of time per student, and we
            didn’t have always have good alignment.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            Our “customer” is a person who is un- or under-employed, who is able,
            willing and ready to work, and who would benefit from an intensive
            training program. This leaves out several segments of the population:
            obviously, people who are already working, who can’t or don’t want to
            work, and crucially, those who do want to work but experience additional
            profound challenges that mean they require extra support and services.
            These latter people are not our sweet spot, not because we don’t want to
            serve them, but just because they need so much more than we can
            currently offer. Fortunately, there are a number of programs and
            organizations in town who are already doing this profoundly important
            work.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We continue to believe that there is a significant spectrum of people
            who want to work, are able to work, and could benefit from the skills,
            confidence, experience and connections that FirstCourse can offer. The
            challenge has been in getting in touch with them; it’s a marketing
            problem, really. We always knew this would be a challenge, so by design
            we planned to lean heavily on the social service organizations as
            “feeders”, or to turn it around, we offer our training as a pipeline
            service to the organizations and their clients, rather than trying to
            duplicate their deep ties to the communities they serve. But so far, it
            has been difficult to establish the partnerships that make this
            possible. Part of this is natural: we have to earn the trust of the
            social service organizations to whose clients we aim to offer our
            services; in our first couple of interactions, we can’t expect to be
            their priority, even if they are ours. We continue to earn and keep this
            trust, so this will keep getting better.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We will continue to seek new ways to get our word out, build our
            reputation, and build a network of allies, graduates, and supporters.
          </p>
          <h2 class="black-50">About the Graduation Bonus</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We have always been committed to treating our students with the dignity
            and respect that they deserve, and to demonstrating that in addition to
            saying that. One of the ways we do this is by paying them for their
            time. As you know, FirstCourse is effectively paid training: all of our
            graduates received $1000 grants for completion. If you want to do the
            math, that ends up being about $14/h. We love this aspect of how we do
            things, and what it represents, but it has caused some distortion,
            perhaps a perverse incentive to enroll in the class:
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            So, FirstCourse is fun. The students love it; the teachers love it; the
            guest chefs love it; I love it. It’s a great way to spend three weeks,
            and to get paid to do that is pretty fantastic. But our mission isn’t to
            teach fun cooking classes, it’s job training for kitchen jobs.
            Unfortunately, a number of our students were not well aligned to our
            goals: some were already working, some weren’t sincere about their goals
            to work in the field, some already had experience in the field. Some
            just heard that you could take a cool cooking course for three weeks and
            take home $1000. This means that we had a bunch of graduates who
            contributed greatly to class, but then didn’t seek employment in the
            culinary field upon graduation. We believe that the bonus is part — but
            not all — of this dynamic.
          </p>
          <h3 class="black-40">A Waste?</h3>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            Normally it wouldn’t be a big deal to “waste” money in this way, paying
            people for their time and doing job training are both objectively good
            things. But I consider our startup money — your money — to be a precious
            and finite resource; it’s our runway. And we can’t learn from our
            graduates if they don’t work in the field: we can’t query their
            employers, we can’t interview them, we can’t close the circle to refine
            and improve our services. It’s also created a bit of awkwardness where
            we can’t keep a connection alive to our graduates: they feel sheepish
            about not working in the field, so don’t want to connect with us to
            refine curriculums, have exit interviews, etc. We can’t reach them, so
            we can’t learn from them, nor can we create the peer network for
            graduates that we aim to create.
          </p>
          <h3 class="black-40">How to Keep It?</h3>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            We do want to keep the principle of the bonus: that people’s time is
            valuable and they should expect it to be treated as such. But we will
            have to find another way. Fortunately, we can rely on our peers around
            the country for other models. Our membership in Catalyst Kitchens
            program (as mentioned above) will offer some other innovations that we
            can learn from, like tying bonus to post-graduation work.
          </p>
          <h2 class="black-50">About People with More Profound Needs</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            I don’t have to tell you how one of the chief challenges of poverty and
            lack of equity is how complicated it can be. Something as simple as
            transportation can be a daunting crisis for some. For us, it might just
            be “what do you mean, it’s an 8 minute drive?” but for some, it might be
            1:45 on the bus, with only one shot to make the connection at a transfer
            point. And what if the babysitter shows up late and you miss that bus?
            Let alone family support, or profound challenges like homelessness or
            substance abuse. FoodWorks is simply not equipped or trained to help
            people with these some of these extra challenges. Fortunately, some
            other excellent organizations are. We have a growing connection to
            <a href="https://www.justbakerymadison.org/" target="_blank" title="Just Bakery's website">Just Bakery</a>
            who does all this and more.
          </p>
          <h2 class="black-50">About the Value of Networks</h2>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            Perhaps the biggest thing we learned is something that probably should
            have been obvious: for some
            <strong>
              our network of aligned employers is just as valuable as our training </strong>. Looking back, I’m embarrassed that I
            didn’t suss this out earlier, as
            it seems so obvious now. It first came to me in our first round of
            FirstCourse, when one of our most engaged and excited students mentioned
            that he hadn’t heard of the Willy Street Coop. The Coop is such a big
            part of my Madison, that it honestly didn’t occur to me that someone who
            was interested in food and cooking may not have heard of it. And if he
            hadn’t heard of it, he certainly wouldn’t know that they offer good pay
            and benefits, and have a central kitchen that employs a bunch of prep
            cooks. This is a form of cultural ignorance on my part, but it led to an
            insight that I think is important: to generalize, many of the best and
            most progressive would-be employers in and around Madison were simply
            not in the orbit, or social-graph, if you will, of many of our students.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            Also, with lots of friends in the “service industry” I’ve noticed that
            there is an informal support network of those who work in the field. It
            can look like gossip to outsiders, but among certain people who work in
            the food industry, everyone knows who pays well, who’s a decent boss (or
            a terrible one), who is about to open a new place, who has flexible
            hours, who’s cool about maternity leave, etc. This network forms a
            valuable support function for people in the industry, and I’ve thought
            long about how to include more people like our students into it, or at
            the very least, to use our knowledge of it to help curate the
            connections between job-seekers and employers.
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            And there are a number of people in Madison who already work in the
            culinary field, but would like to upgrade to a job with better pay,
            nicer boss, better benefits, or just one that has more of a career
            track. Those people don’t really need our training, but they certainly
            would benefit from a service that matched them with jobs among the best
            progressive employers in the industry. It would be wonderful to be able
            to offer this service to more people than just our graduates, and to
            offer it systematically and sustainably rather than just ad-hoc.
          </p>
          <h3 class="black-40">Build that Network</h3>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
            Last year, we wrote a grant to formalize and bootstrap this process: to
            get serious about match-making in the professional kitchen world, design
            a system, capture data, hire a match-maker staff person and so on. We
            aimed to start with our own graduates to design and build the system,
            then to operate it as a public utility for all job seekers and employers
            in the culinary sector in and around Madison. Unfortunately, we didn’t
            get that grant, but I continue to think it’s a key piece of the puzzle,
            and we’re continuing to noodle on how to build it and what its business
            model should be. So, more on this later. Meanwhile, we will continue the
            ad-hoc process of matching graduates to employers according to their
            mutual needs and alignments.
